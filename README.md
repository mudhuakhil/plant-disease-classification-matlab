# Plant Disease Classification

## Overview
The Plant Disease Classification project aims to identify and classify various plant diseases using MATLAB. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms and techniques to classify images of plants into healthy and diseased categories.

## Features
- Image processing and feature extraction from plant images.
- Utilization of machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, etc.
- User-friendly interface for uploading images and receiving classification results.
- Visualization of classification results and model accuracy.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2020a or later.
- Image Processing Toolbox.
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mudhuakhil/plant-disease-classification-matlab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd plant-disease-classification-matlab
   ```
3. Open the project in MATLAB and run the main script.

## Usage
1. Launch the application and upload an image of a plant leaf.
2. The application will preprocess the image and extract relevant features.
3. The model will classify the image and display the results along with the probability scores.
